# Task

Develop the KBC game using C. The program should have the following features:

1. First of all, primary information, such as the total number of questions, prize money with respect to each question, available life lines and intermediate question levels (described in point no. 4 below) should be displayed on the screen, asking the user to press any key to start the game.

2. When notified by the user, the game should start by displaying one question at a time along with its four options on the screen, prompting the user to select the correct option.

3. When the user selects his/her option, the program should show a message whether the selected option is correct or wrong.
4. If the selected option is correct, the corresponding prize money should be displayed. Otherwise, the prize money counter should be reduced to zero or to the intermediate level (e.g., after question number 3, 8 and 12, as set by you), and displayed on the screen.

5. The user can opt for two life lines, such as “50-50”, upon selection of which, two wrong options should be removed from the screen, or “flip the question” that should replace the entire question with a new one on the screen. These life lines can be availed by the user only once (even at the same time as well). Therefore, the program should take care of this provision.

6. The maximum number of questions a user can play should not exceed 15.
